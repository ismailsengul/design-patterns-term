# design-patterns-term

This project is called Dream Team. With the Dream Team application, you can create your own users and create soccer, 
volleyball, and basketball teams and organize tournaments between the created teams. When we were making this project, 
we didn't use any design patterns at first and we saw how difficult it is to develop an application without using design patterns. 
In the sections for creating teams and tournaments, we used the Factory Method. In addition, in the sections for joining a team 
or tournament, we also benefit from the Strategy pattern.

Scope: The application will have three main menu options: user, team and tournament.

User menu:

 - Users will be able to create a personal profile, including their name, email address, and their age.
 - User will be able to list teams and join one of the teams.

Team menu:

 - Users will be able to create a team including team name and member capacity.
 - Users will be able to show the teams.
 - Users will be able to join a tournament with the same type as the team they are into.

Tournament menu:

 - Users will be able to create a tournament by choosing a type between football, basketball and voleyball
   including tournament name and team capacity. 
 - Users will be able to show the tournaments.
